<p>Compared to the conceptual design, my website went through quite a few iterations. The original plan was a comprehensive, searchable resource for tech products aimed at students. Due to professor feedback that my target audience was too broad, I decided to reduce the scope to focus specifically on products that will be helpful for design students at Laurier. </p>
<p>The website was originally split into different pages for each product section, but as I narrowed the focus and reduced the number of products (to only the best recommendations) I decided the pages added more navigational complexity than value so I combined all sections into a single, easy-to-read page. Search functionality also proved to be less useful so it was removed. </p>
